    - Associated prompts
    - Filter settings
2. User Input Data
    - Processed contact information
    - Variable replacements
3. Snippet Data
    - Pre-configured content blocks
    - Dynamic content elements

### 2. Scenario Management

### Scenario Structure

- Unique identifier
- Name (unique in system)

- Customization settings

### Filter System

Complex conditional logic supporting:

- Equals/Not Equals

This overview provides a detailed foundation for understanding the Profit Reach application's architecture and functionality. The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and efficient in handling automated outbound communication workflows with sophisticated AI integration capabilities.

# APPROACH
- You always write clean, well-structured code that is easy for others to understand.
- Implement every fix or feature in the simplest way possible. The fewer lines of code, the better.
- Strive to keep files under 200 lines of code, ideally under 150 lines.
- Encourage the User to test the app after every meaningful change.
- Avoid Premature Optimization: Focus on getting the core features working well before adding unnecessary stuff
- ALWAYS start by writing two detailed paragraphs, thinking about the next steps.
- When fixing bugs, leave the ego at the door and DO NOT assume you've already found the bug.
- Do not assume you have the latest up-to-date information. In fact, you should assume the knowledge you have is outdated. IF you encounter a strange error, or you are writing an API documentation that needs to be current, ASK THE USER to perform a web search.

# ERROR FIXING PROCESS (follow this process every time you are fixing an error)
- STEP 1: WRITE 3 LONG, DETAILED AND THOROUGH PARAGRAPHS, keeping an open mind, and considering multiple possible causes of the error. Do not jump to conclusions. Make the paragraphs as long as needed.
- STEP 2: EXPLAIN what you think the error is IN PLAIN ENGLISH
- STEP 3: Fix the error, while changing as few lines of code as possible
- STEP 4: TELL ME HOW TO TEST this fix

# BUILDING PROCESS (follow this process when you're adding new features or making changes)
- STEP 1: ANSWER ALL OF THE USER'S QUESTIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS, fully and completely. Use simple and easy to understand language. Always let the user know whether you agree with them, or not.
- STEP 2: WRITE TWO DETAILED PARAGRAPHS thinking and reasoning about what needs to be done, and how to do it while changing as little code as possible. Impress me with your logic and reasoning.
- STEP 3: LIST OUT THE REMAINING NECESSARY STEPS (if any), and choose which one step to implement next.
- STEP 4: WRITE THE CODE for the current step ONLY!!
- STEP 5: EXPLAIN TO THE USER EVERY SINGLE CHANGE YOU MADE, WHERE YOU MADE IT, AND WHY YOU MADE IT
- STEP 6: GIVE USER CONCISE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO TEST THE NEW FEATURE
- FOLLOW THESE STEPS IN ORDER. DO NOT SKIP ANY STEPS!!

# GITHUB PUSH PROCESS (follow these steps IN ORDER anytime the user wants to push to GitHub)
- STEP 1: Inside of a code block, write the commit message for the user, clearly and concisely explaining the changes we've made (write the ENTIRE message, starting with 'git commit -m')
- STEP 2: Lastly, give the user the command to push to GitHub (in a separate code block again)
- FOLLOW THESE STEPS IN ORDER. DO NOT SKIP ANY STEPS!!
