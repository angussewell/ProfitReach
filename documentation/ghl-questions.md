I had this initially, but make sure that on this page: (https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/a04191c0fabf9-authorization), step 3, that the app in your app marketplace corresponds with the redirect url AND the scopes are correct. I found that my scopes were incorrect and received that error until I corrected the scopes. Here is the example: https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/oauth/chooselocation?
response_type=code&
redirect_uri=https://myapp.com/oauth/callback/gohighlevel&
client_id=CLIENT_ID&
scope=conversations/message.readonly conversations/message.write

The issue I am having now is that not all the endpoints in API 2.0 are represented by the available scopes, which makes API 2.0 far from ready to deploy and replace API 1.0. I would strongly suggest API 1.0 not be replaced for at least 6 months after API 2.0 is complete. For example, the endpoint for Add Followers exists, but its not accessible with the available scopes. Critical error. The other critical error is how the conversations endpoints work. Please vote for this: https://ideas.gohighlevel.com/automations/p/new-contacts-followers-almost-uslesshttps://ideas.gohighlevel.com/automations/p/new-contacts-followers-almost-uslesshttps://ideas.gohighlevel.com/automations/p/new-contacts-followers-almost-usless

Can I obtain the access token directly through https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/00d0c0ecaa369-get-access-token without using the authorization code? I'm facing challenges automating this process on Cloud Functions using Python because the authorization code prompts a window where I have to manually select the subaccount. How can I automate the token retrieval for each subaccount without going through the authorization step?

This is the exact problem I'm having. The 'code' in the query params that is used to generate the authentication token at callback seems to only be instantiated by a manual selection of an account. Are we missing something here or does this API truly only function in the context of a user having to manually login?

Hi there. I successfully receive a token and place it in the authorization header (with "Bearer" prefix) but I get the following error when I actually do an API request to some endpoint:

`Token's user type mismatch!`

I made 10000% sure that I pass "user_type" (Location) in the token request. 

I am stuck! Any ideas? Help?

I gave up trying to use this for server to server data object transmissions because it wasnt even giving me correct scopes back with valid API calls. - I surmise the ultimate solution (in the event we had time for app dev) would be to set up a node server like this man has going, generate the initial keys, then set up an infinite daily refresh for new tokens that are passed in as a variable to whatever API calls you want to make from server to server. In our case we just wanted to post a contact object on form submission to the respective GHL subaccount. We decided not to do this because of lack of devlopment time. Instead we used a native GHL form and passed info we needed into hidden fields in the form via query parameters. Kind of unfortunate that we had to jerry-rig this but we did not have time to deal with debugging, app dev, and other hassles from this API

Guys, I did it!!!
I just had to clarify this, without this useless 14 minute video.
You can follow the video up to minute 3:50 then:
- access the url (read the guide https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/a04191c0fabf9-authorization)
pay attention that the url is written all on one line
- copy and paste in the browser
- select "Agency" or the Sub-account you want (I use Agency) and continue
- once the redirect is done copy the "code" parameter and save it
- call the "Get access token" api with grant_type='authorization_code' and save the expiration date, the token and the refresh_token in the database
- the token expires after one day, before using it, check the expiration date in the db, if it has expired:
call the "Get access token" api with grant_type='refresh_token' using the last saved refresh_token

Basically the "code" parameter is only needed the first time, then you can always get new tokens using the last valid refresh_token with the "Get access token" api with grant_type='refresh_token' .
I hope I was clear, I don't understand why they didn't explain it like this in the documentation.

You're confusing people here by using code when it's unnecessary. You should just be manually typing the URL into the browser. i understand that you aren't wanting to expose secrets here, but there was a better way to go about this that wouldn't have made it seem like you need to spin up a server just to get the auth code.

So annoying and in my opinion pointless that you blank out the screen. You can just delete your key secret even the app after making the video...

The video however is useful, but this auth flow is not fun for automated processes that don't need or want user intervention. I just have a simple app that looks for an opportunity in a certain state then kicks off a process. I don't need a user based process to get a token.

You really need to provide a client_credential flow. so that you can do machine to machine authentication. for api usage we can't always ask for user interaction unless the auth token is a long lived token and we only do this once. also, how do you provide a callback url if your app is auth protected? this means you need the callback url public right?

Postman should really be the first example to show here as this is how most people are going to gain access to keys...

You can also use it's in-built oauth2 functionality to receive your request code and bearer token without needing to run a nodeJS app to get your request code.

But the downside of most oauth implementations is that bearer and refresh tokens expire, making it a poor solution for server to server integrations.

I have a NodeJS program that uses the V1 API now, and I'd like to convert it to V2. It runs unattended, so I can't prompt the user or open a browser. Is this supported in V2?

I have gotten to this point but am getting 'version header was not found' even though the version is correctly specified in the headers.

I've got this error: "This authClass type is not allowed to access this scope. Please reach out to the Platform team to get it added". How to fix this? I've the scopes I added are only this: "calendars/events.readonly",
"calendars/events.write".

If I need to post to a sub-account via a backend API request how am I supposed to get around the part where the 'code' in the query parameter returned to the callback path is produced from the process of physically selecting an account from the login page that the initiate path directs one to? Is there someway to handle this programmatically? Also the code generated from the GHL account login screen that is returned to the callback path is only valid once for generation of an Authentication token....

When does the access token expire?  I am assuming this is when you use the refresh token?

I have made some real good progress here. I have successfully retrieved the 'code'. However, now I am struggling to understand which 'Scope' to select. I recieved this error: "The token is not authorized for this scope." If every endpoint must be assigned to a scope, which one does this belong to? I need to select when using the 'Add Followers' endpoint: https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/d6499bc9a04e7-add-followers

This is a showstopping issue for me as well. I've successfully implemented the OAuth flow. I'm able to authenticate and refresh expired tokens.

I can call any api I requested in the the scopes on my app and in my authentication call.

However, I can not execute workflow triggers and will always get The token is not authorized for this scope. 

Support has not been helpful at all.

why even share your screen if you are going to use sensitive info and block it from being seen?

I suggest to replace it with something meaningful and people to understand.

Wow, this seems like an incredibly over complicated process. I currently send contact data to clients based on a completed phone call from another piece of software. Simple REST API via webhook. It seems I know need to hire a developer to maintain this functionality, cause most of this is way over my head :(

Not a very high quality video.
Normally we want people without strong accents to do a tutorial. Sometimes half the screen was blacked out to hide screen details. Just cancel tokens after the video and show everything. API doesnt show how to fetch multiple pages, what the default number of records is. we dont know. In General Stripe has best support, best developers, best developers help on Discord. Research Stripe and so what they do. Your APi is unnecessary complex. Why you want us refreshing tokens every 24 hours for? Are you the NSA? Are developers asking for this? No, then why do it.

Solving a problem that doesn't exist. Creating job security for the developers who created this nonsense? It'll be the stake in the coffin that finally gets me to leave the shitshow that is HighLevel.

How on earth does a service like highlevel not offer the STANDARD OAuth 2 client credential flow for systems to integrate with each-other. The terrible developer experience for something as simple as getting a token makes me extremely hesitant about using HighLevel

As far as I can see, it is standard oauth2?
I think this is just a poor explainer - there's really no need to use a stand alone app to get keys.

For example, you can totally use postman to get token and credentials.
