        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our websites 
        <code>app.messagelm.com</code> and <code>tempshift.ai</code> (collectively, the "Sites"), and use our services 
        (collectively, the "Services"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this 
        privacy policy, please do not access the sites or use the services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any

      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Services includes:</p>
      <h3>Personal Data You Provide to Us</h3>
      <p>
        We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register for an account (if applicable), 
        express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities 
        on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us. The personal information that we collect depends on the context of 
        your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal 
        information we collect may include the following: name, email address, phone number, company information, and other 
        information you choose to provide.
      </p>
      <h3>Information from Third-Party Services (e.g., GoHighLevel)</h3>
      <p>
        Our Services integrate with third-party platforms such as GoHighLevel ("GHL"). When you connect your GHL account or 
        utilize our Services to process data from GHL, we may access and process contact information and other data stored in 
        your GHL account as directed by you. This may include names, email addresses, phone numbers, custom field data, and 
        other information related to your contacts. We process this data solely to provide the Services you have requested.
      </p>
      <h3>Information from Research APIs (e.g., Perplexity API)</h3>
      <p>
        If you use features that involve AI-powered research through APIs like Perplexity, we may send queries (which may be 
        derived from data you provide or configure) to these services. We strive to ensure that any personally identifiable 
        information sent is minimized and relevant to the research task. The results of such research are processed and may be 
        stored as part of the Services we provide to you.
      </p>
      <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
      <p>
        Our Sites and Services do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies to collect personal information about your 
        browsing activities. We may collect limited non-personally identifiable information automatically, such as IP address, 
        browser type, operating system, access times, and the pages you have viewed directly before and after accessing the Site 
        for the purpose of operating and improving our Services, ensuring security, and for system administration.
      </p>

      <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
      <p>We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:</p>
      <h3>By Law or to Protect Rights</h3>
      <p>
        If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy 
        potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your 
        information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.
      </p>
      <h3>Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
      <p>
        We may share your information with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services 
        for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include: data storage providers 
        (e.g., Neon PostgreSQL), API providers for integrated functionalities (e.g., GoHighLevel, Perplexity), and communication 
        services. We ensure these third parties are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential 
        and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
      </p>
      <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
      <p>
        We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company 
        assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
      </p>
      <h3>With Your Consent</h3>
      <p>We may disclose your personal information for any other purpose with your consent.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we 
        have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our 
        efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed 
        against any interception or other type of misuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, 
        unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). 
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, 
        or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we 
        will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>

        jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we 
        transfer the data, including personal data, to the United States and process it there. Our service providers may also
