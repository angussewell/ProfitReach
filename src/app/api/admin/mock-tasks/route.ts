I work with Scale Your Cause. I saw we were both connected to XYZ Mutual Connection, so I thought I'd reach out.\"\nThen you'd continue with something like: \"We've been seeing a lot of other food shelters (or whatever their nonprofit type is) in Austin (or whatever their city is) such as Competitor 1 and Competitor 2 using the Google Ads grant and signing up for the Google Ads grant. So we've decided to shift our focus to food nonprofits (or whatever their type of nonprofit is).\"\nNext, you'd mention: \"We're having a few open spots this month for our Google Ad Grant giveaway where we're basically setting up Google Ad Grant for a few non-profits completely for no cost at all.\"\nThen you'd ask: \"Do you know anybody that might be interested in something like this?\" This is important because you want to frame it as an open-handed question.\nYou'd personalize it with: \"Since you're [title] in this, since you have a background in this, since you (personalized aspect of why you are reaching out) I thought you were the person to reach out to.\"\nThat's the exact approach - very conversational, referencing mutual connections, mentioning competitors, offering limited spots for free setup, and asking who they might know who could benefit rather than directly selling to them.\n",
